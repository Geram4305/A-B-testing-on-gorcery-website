# A/B Testing on Grocery Website Data
This repository contains the code and data for conducting A/B testing on a grocery website. The goal of the experiment is to determine whether changing the color of a button from blue to orange increases the number of clicks on the website.

# Experiment Overview
The grocery website made a specific change to their interface by replacing the blue button with an orange button. The metric used to measure the effectiveness of this change is the ratio of users who enter the target page compared to all users who enter the website. The experiment aims to determine if the color change has a significant impact on user engagement and click-through rates.

# Steps followed
Control and Experiment Group Split: Randomly assign website visitors to either the control group (exposed to the blue button) or the experiment group (exposed to the orange button).

# Normality Test
Perform a normality test on the data to ensure that it follows a normal distribution. This step helps in selecting the appropriate hypothesis test for analysis.

# Hypothesis Testing
Apply the appropriate statistical hypothesis test to compare the results between the control and experiment groups. This analysis will provide insights into the statistical significance of the color change on user engagement.

# Suggestion on Launching the Website
Based on the results of the hypothesis test, provide recommendations on whether to implement the orange button across the entire website or revert back to the blue button.
